## Overview

In the modern era, businesses are increasingly relying on web and cloud-based platforms. One critical aspect of enhancing customer experience is understanding and reacting to customer emotions during interactions. This project presents a framework designed to improve customer service through emotion detection and sentiment analysis.

The framework uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) to classify emotions in speech into categories such as angry, neutral, disappointed, or happy. It also includes sentiment analysis of textual input using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This dual-phase system not only routes customer queries to the appropriate technical experts based on initial chat queries but also automatically grades customer service representatives based on the emotional tone of their speech.

## Lessons Learned

This project highlighted the importance of combining sentiment analysis and emotion recognition to enhance customer service effectively. We also gained valuable insights into optimizing deep learning models for real-time emotion detection, improving both accuracy and user experience.


Key components of the project include:

- **Pre-processing:** Cleaning and preparing text data.
- **LSTM Classification:** Identifying the emotion from the text.
- **Speech Emotion Recognition:** Using CNN to analyze speech signals.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting features such as MFCC, Mel, and Chroma.
- **Model Training:** Tuning hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.
